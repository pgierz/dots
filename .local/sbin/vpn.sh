# ================================================================================  
# Provides a quick-access CLI interface for Cisco Anyconnect and any VPN binary
# which provides the `connect` and `disconnect` subcommands. This has **only**
# been tested on Cisco Anyconnect!
# 
# Usage:
# ------
# 
#     $ vpn.sh on   # Will connect to ${VPN_SERVER}
#     $ vpn.sh off  # Will disconnect to ${VPN_SERVER}
#     $ vpn.sh test # Will print to screen an example file with user credentials which would be piped to the ${VPN_BIN} program
# 
# Arguments:
# ----------
# ``$1`` : ``string``
# 
#     * ``on``, ``connect``: Establish the VPN connection
#     * `off``, ``disconnect``: Disconnect from the VPN connection
#     * ``test``: Determine if the file containing the user information and password is being correctly written.
# 
# Optional Files:
# ---------------
# ``# ${PASSWORD_INFO_FILE}`` :
# This file contains user name and password information. Defaults to
# ``${HOME}/.config/cisco/login_info.txt``. This can be set via environment
# variable, please see the next section.
# 
# Environment Variables:
# ----------------------
# ``${VPN_BIN}`` :
# 
#     Location of the vpn program to use (e.g. Cisco Anyconnect) Defaults to
# ``/opt/cisco/secureclient/bin/vpn``
# 
# ``${VPN_SERVER}`` :
# 
#     The server address to connect to. Defaults to vpn.awi.de
# 
# ``${PASSWORD_INFO_FILE}`` :
# 
#     File with username and password information in the following format::
# 
#         $ cat ${PASSWORD_INFO_FILE}
#         <user_name>
#         <password>
#         y
# 
#     Defaults to ``${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:=${HOME}/.config}/cisco/login_info.txt``, each entry should be on a separate line.
# 
#     Note that the final ``y`` in this file is "yes", to accept the security disclaimer automatically.
# 
#     If such a file is not available, tries to use the ``${HOME}/.netrc file``
